 * Description:
 * ===========
 * 
 * Reducers are the ones in charge of updating the state of the app.
 * Redux will automatically pass the current state of the app and the action occurred.
 * Itâ€™s up to the reducer to realize if it needs to modify the state or not based on the action.type.
 * Thatâ€™s why almost every time our reducer will be a function containing a switch statement,
 *  which modifies and returns the state based on what action occurred.
 *  Its important that reducers never mutate the state in place,
 * instead it should replace the keys that it needs to be changed.
 * So if you look at all the cases, we never mutate state directly
 *  but instead use Object.assign which creates new object having the target fields replaced with the updated one.
